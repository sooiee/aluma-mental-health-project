# aluma-mental-health-project
The Aluma mental health awareness website is a website that provides information on the most common mental health issues, how to recognise the signs and ways to manage the symptoms. Further advice on how to recognise the signs on others and how to help them is also provided. This website was built as a project as part of my course.

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Here is a link to the live site [here]()

## DESIGN & PLANNING:
### USER EXPERIENCE (UX)
Designing a website focused on mental health requires special attention to creating a supportive, calming, and accessible user experience that meets the unique emotional and cognitive needs of users. Our UX design approach emphasizes:

* User-Centered Design ensuring all content and interactions feel intuitive, compassionate, and non-overwhelming.
* The interface avoids clutter and confusing navigation. Content is presented in clear, digestible sections with straightforward language to reduce cognitive overload and anxiety.
* Calming Visual Aesthetics with a soothing color palette and uncluttered layouts create a peaceful atmosphere. Positive affirmations and encouraging messages further foster a supportive environment.
* Accessibility and Inclusivity, high color contrast, descriptive alt text for images, font sizes and spacing are chosen for readability.
* Responsiveness Across Devices
* Interactive elements like buttons and links provide immediate visual feedback on focus, hover, and click states. This helps users feel confident in their navigation and engagement.




### USER STORIES
Client Goals:
* Create a welcoming and calming website that offers accessible, beginner-friendly information about mental health.
* Provide clear navigation and structure so users can easily find the information they need, whether about mental health issues, recognition, or management.
* Ensure the website is responsive and accessible, for users on any device or with disabilities.
* Use modern front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) to produce a clean, supportive experience.
* Deploy the website with version control and maintain clear documentation for easy updates and reliability.

First-Time Visitors:
* Expecting to be greeted by a positive, encouraging hero section with calming colors and supportive messaging.
* Want to quickly identify common mental health problems and gain a basic understanding of symptoms and signs.
* Seek easy-to-understand stress management and self-care tips, presented in clear, visually distinct cards.
* Wish to access trustworthy external resources for further help or professional guidance.
* Appreciate uplifting affirmations or encouraging quotes to feel supported while exploring mental health topics.
* Need a responsive layout that looks good and functions well on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

Returning Visitors:
* Want to navigate directly to specific pages covering mental health issues, recognition, or management strategies.
* Expect the site to offer well-organised content hierarchy and quick access to new or updated information.
* Benefit from an experience that remembers accessibility and responsiveness, making repeated visits smooth and comfortable.
* Desire interactive elements with clear feedback for buttons, links, and any media for enhanced usability.
* Need confidence that the site content is accurate, credible, and regularly maintained.

### WIREFRAMES

## BUGS
Bugs fixed using copilot:
### 1. Resources Section Styling Not Appearing on Deployed Page
Issue: Custom CSS styles for the resources section weren't displaying on the live site


Root Causes:
Duplicate closing </section> tag breaking HTML structure
CSS conflicts between old flexbox mobile styles and new grid layout
CSS specificity issues with Bootstrap overriding custom styles


Solution:
Removed duplicate HTML tag
Updated mobile media queries to use grid-template-columns: 1fr instead of flex-direction: column
Added !important declarations for critical grid layout properties

### 2. Responsive Navigation Menu Issues
Issue: Mobile hamburger menu not functioning properly across all devices


Solution: Implemented CSS-only toggle system using hidden checkbox and label approach with proper media queries for different screen sizes

### 3. Card Layout Breaking on Small Screens
Issue: Cards overlapping or becoming unreadable on mobile devices


Solution:
Implemented responsive flexbox with flex: 1 1 300px for adaptive sizing
Added multiple media query breakpoints (480px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px)
Used clamp() functions for responsive typography

### 4. Modal Accessibility and Mobile Experience
Issue: Modals not properly displaying full-screen on mobile devices


Solution:
Added modal-fullscreen class with proper viewport sizing
Implemented tabindex="-1" to remove modals from tab order
Added proper ARIA labels for screen readers


### 5. Cross-browser Font Loading Issues
Issue: Fonts not loading consistently across different browsers


Solution:
Proper Google Fonts import with fallback fonts
Used font-display: swap parameter for better performance

### 6. Content Overflow and Inconsistent Heights
Issue: Cards with varying content lengths causing layout issues


Solution:
Implemented flexbox with justify-content: space-between in card content
Used flex: 1 for expanding content areas
Set consistent min-height values for visual uniformity

### 7. UK English Spelling Inconsistencies
Issue: Mixed American/British English spelling throughout content


Solution: Systematic replacement of all visible text to use UK English spelling (e.g., "recognise" instead of "recognize", "colour" instead of "color")
